## Instructions for Use
The repository consists of four Matlab scripts:

`FHN_continuous_avg_HFS.m` consists code for the reproduction of Fig. 6 in Ref. [1], which demonstrates the inhibition of pulse propagation in continuous neuron under high-frequency stimulation (HFS).

`myelinated_FHN_averaged.m` is modeling dynamics of pulse propagation in myelinated neuron. Here averaged equations is solved.

`myelinated_FHN_HFS.m` is modeling dynamics of pulse propagation in myelinated neuron under HFS.
